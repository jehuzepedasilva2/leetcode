# 🧠 LeetCode Mastery Game Plan

## 🎯 Goal

Become highly proficient at solving LeetCode-style problems, especially for coding interviews.

---

## 📅 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Build a strong base in data structures & algorithms (DSA).

### 🔍 Focus Topics

- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, Sets
- Recursion, Sorting & Searching
- Time & Space Complexity

### 📘 Resources

- [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
- [LeetCode Explore Cards](https://leetcode.com/explore/)
- [CS50 (Harvard)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
- freeCodeCamp Algorithms + DSA courses

### 📆 Daily Routine

- 1 hour: Learn or review one DSA topic
- Solve 2 problems (1 Easy + 1 Medium)

---

## 📅 Phase 2: Problem-Solving Core (Weeks 3–6)

**Goal:** Build consistency and improve pattern recognition.

### 🧩 Focus Areas (in order)

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers & Sliding Window
- Stack & Monotonic Stack
- Binary Search
- Linked Lists
- Trees (DFS, BFS)
- Recursion & Backtracking

### 📆 Daily Routine (2–3 hours)

- Solve 3 problems/day (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- For each problem:
  - Try solving for 30 min max
  - Review optimal solution
  - Re-implement from scratch without notes

### 📊 Track Progress

- Use a Notion table or spreadsheet
- Mark each as ✅ Solved | 🔁 Retry | ❌ Gave up

---

## 📅 Phase 3: Advanced Patterns + Timed Practice (Weeks 7–10)

**Goal:** Improve under time pressure and master edge cases.

### 📘 Topics

- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, Topological Sort)
- Heaps, Priority Queues
- Tries & Union Find

### ⏱️ Timed Sets

- 3x/week: Do a mock set (2–3 problems in 1 hour)
- Use [LeetCode Contest Archives](https://leetcode.com/contest/)

### 🔄 Weekly Review

- Re-do tough problems from the week
- Document patterns, tricks, mistakes

---

## 📅 Phase 4: Mock Interviews & Realistic Prep (Weeks 11–12+)

**Goal:** Simulate real interview conditions.

### 👥 Mock Interviews

- Use platforms like:
  - [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/)
  - [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
  - [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/)

### 🎙️ Interview Simulation

- Set a 45-minute timer
- Solve 1-2 medium/hard problems
- Talk through your thought process aloud

---

## 🛠️ Extra Tips

- Use Anki or flashcards for key patterns
- Re-do missed problems weekly
- Analyze why you got something wrong
- Stay consistent: even 1–2 hours/day works if regular

---

## 📚 Bonus: CS50 - Harvard's Free CS Course

- Website: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
- YouTube: [CS50 2023 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T383Vx9-4vJYFsJbvZ_D17Qzh)
- Covers core programming, data structures, and algorithms
