# 271. Encode and Decode Strings

$\textsf{\color{Goldenrod} Medium}$

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

### Example 1:

    Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

    Output:["neet","code","love","you"]

### Example 2:

    Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

    Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]

### Constraints:

    0 <= strs.length < 100
    0 <= strs[i].length < 200
    strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.

### Recommended Time and Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with `O(m)` time for each `encode()` and `decode()` call and `O(m+n)` space, where `m` is the sum of lengths of all the strings and `n` is the number of strings.
